## Formal presentation

Hi, my name is Bruno Eduardo de Oliveira Meneguele, I am from Brazil and also
am a computer engineer interested in about everything related to operating
systems development or any other low level discussion you can imagine. I have
around 3 years of embedded and Linux Kernel development experience, focusing
mainly in the security field of these.

Currently I am Software Engineer in the Core Kernel development team at [Red
Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en).

## Ok, lets talk: about this blog

Although I am currently employed by Red Hat I still am pretty new to the Kernel
development _per se_. Because of that everything you are going to find in this
personal blog is basically myself trying to figure out how some stuff works,
maybe directly related to the Linux Kernel, but others just random curiosity.

Also, although I am a **Linux Kernel** developer it does not mean I won't share
any information about other operating systems. Actually you might get
surprised on how interested I am about that in general, mostly the
BSD family. So be warned.

You can find me walking around on IRC, mostly OFTC server (#kernelnewbies
channel) as _bmeneg_. You also can ping or follow me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/bmeneguele). Do not hesitate to reach me out.
