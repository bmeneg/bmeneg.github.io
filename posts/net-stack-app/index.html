<main>


<p>One of the things I have been studying in the past few days is how the
networking stack works in our lives nowadays:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the standard protocols?</li>
<li>How these protocols work?</li>
<li>How everything are integrated?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions guided me towards a &ldquo;playing around&rdquo; exercise: build a simple
HTTP server and follow all the steps that a simple data packet goes throughout
the networking stack (top-down approach).</p>

<p>Some tooling necessary to either allow us to send a packet through the stack
and also to follow its steps downwards. Each tool are going to be presented as
required.</p>

<h1 id="application-layer">Application layer</h1>

<p>The application layer is basically where the user start requesting things in
order to get a result or a reply from something/one. Any action performed by
the user in a web browser or in a video streaming application ends up in a
packet being sent to a server or to another user somewhere in the internet.</p>

<p>That is where we are going to start our journey: right in the top of the
networking stack.</p>

<h2 id="our-http-server">Our HTTP server</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use the Perl language to build our HTTP server. I won&rsquo;t get in
details around the code nor how the server is implemented underneath, although
I might present some information about the protocol itself.</p>

<p>The following code will be saved as <em>http-server.pl</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-perl">use warnings;
use strict;

use Net::Async::HTTP::Server;
use IO::Async::Loop;
use HTTP::Response;
use HTTP::Status;

sub handle_request {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($req) = @_;
    my $resp = HTTP::Response-&gt;new(HTTP::Status::HTTP_OK);

    $resp-&gt;add_content(&quot;You have requested: &quot;.$req-&gt;path.&quot;\n&quot;);
    $resp-&gt;content_type(&quot;text/plain&quot;);
    $resp-&gt;content_length(length $resp-&gt;content);
    $req-&gt;respond($resp);
}

my $async_loop = IO::Async::Loop-&gt;new();
my $http_server = Net::Async::HTTP::Server-&gt;new(
    on_request =&gt; \&amp;handle_request
);

$async_loop-&gt;add($http_server);
$http_server-&gt;listen(
    addr =&gt; {
        family =&gt; &quot;inet&quot;,
        socktype =&gt; &quot;stream&quot;,
        port =&gt; 8080
    },
)-&gt;get();

print(&quot;Listening...\n&quot;);
$async_loop-&gt;run();
</code></pre>

<p>With that code running you are already ready to receive requests:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ perl http-server.pl
Listening...
</code></pre>

<p>And in another shell:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ curl http://localhost:8080
You have requested: /
</code></pre>

<h2 id="overview-on-http-protocol-rfc-2616-https-tools-ietf-org-html-rfc2616">Overview on HTTP protocol (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>)</h2>

<p>Being able to send and receive requests is the first step we need to achieve to
start analysing the stack. Now we need to get our hands somewhat dirty within
the HTTP protocol itself to gather some useful information for the rest of our
journey.</p>

<p>HTTP workflow runs basically around two basic concepts: <strong>requests</strong> and
<strong>responses</strong> for those requests. Although it might seems pretty simple, the
protocol is a pretty extensible one, holding a lot of headers that may get
included within each request and/or response. It is out of the scope of this
article to get into details about HTTP protocol and, because of that, we are
going to present only an overview of these concepts.</p>

<h3 id="requests">Requests</h3>

<p>An example of HTTP request is:</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/http-request.png" alt="Got from MDN web docs" /></p>

<p>Which is composed of four main parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>method</strong>: a verb that defines the operation the user wish to perform to the
server. Although usually it is limited to <em>GET</em> and <em>POST</em> methods to,
respectively, fetch and set operations, it is also possible to have other
ones for different purposes, i.e. <em>OPTIONS</em>;</li>
<li><strong>path</strong>: the path to which the user wants to fetch information:</li>
<li><strong>version</strong>: HTTP protocol version;</li>
<li><strong>headers</strong>: additional information to the server. It might inform different
ways the server could handle the request;</li>
<li><strong>body</strong>: in case the method chosen is <em>POST</em> a body may appear under the
headers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using our brand new server we can check the request with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8080
...
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.61.1
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Some other informations are printed out with this command, but the request is
only these four lines.</p>

<h3 id="responses">Responses</h3>

<p>Now, a response example is:</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/http-response.png" alt="Got from MDN web docs" /></p>

<p>Which is composed by the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>version</strong>: HTTP protocol version;</li>
<li><strong>status</strong>: an integer code that represents the status of the request;</li>
<li><strong>message</strong>: a message that shortly describes the status code;</li>
<li><strong>headers</strong>: and more headers that presents additional information that may be
used by the user for any reason;</li>
<li><strong>body</strong>: the response content <em>per se</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The same command used to check request headers we can use to check the
response&rsquo;s ones:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8080
...
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; Date: Wed, 22 May 2019 04:06:21 GMT
&lt; Content-Length: 22
&lt; Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
&lt;
You have requested: /
...
</code></pre>

<h2 id="stack-analysis">Stack analysis</h2>

<p>For this exercise in particular we are interested in a couple of informations
that are present in HTTP packet: being them the <em>Date</em>, that we are planning to
use as a timestamp as checking mechanism later on, and <em>Content-Length</em> which
will help us to understand some lower level protocols behaviors in certain
situations.</p>

<p>You can keep listening your requests and responses in real-time with a tool
called <em>tcpflow</em> which keep track of all TCP connections being performed
through one of your network interfaces:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell"># tcpflow -c -i &lt;interface&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>While in the another shell (or even through a normal browser) you keep
sending requests to your server.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell"># tcpflow -c -i lo
...
::1.40138-::1.08080: GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
User-Agent: curl/7.61.1
Accept: */*


::1.08080-::1.40138: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 22 May 2019 04:32:35 GMT
Content-Length: 22
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

You have requested: /
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that HTTP is an <em>application protocol</em> and has no clue about IP
addresses. I mean, although it has the <em>Host</em> header it is used to pass the
information to an underlying protocol known as Internet Protocol (IP), which
will actively work with it.</p>

<p>When the time is come new requests are going to happen and possible greater
messages as responses bodies as well, but we guarantee that nothing will change
in our server, no magic will be added, only a few characters to the response
content.</p>

<p>Just to finish this first part of the series I think it is worth to mention
that: so far I have used only IP addresses to refer to my <em>localhost</em>,
127.0.0.1, and it happened because I was avoiding to mix information of two
application layer protocols, HTTP and DNS.</p>

<p>In short, DNS is the <em>Domain Name System</em> which is a mechanism to translate
server&rsquo;s names to numerical addresses (IP), since the machines only know about
the numbers, while names are interesting only to humans.</p>

<p>The idea here is not to discuss how neither DNS and HTTP works internally, but
how the network stack is bundled together. Because of that I&rsquo;m stopping here
and leaving a link to the <a href="/posts/net-stack-transport">next series part</a>.</p>
