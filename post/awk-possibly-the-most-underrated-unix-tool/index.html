<h1><span class="title">awk - possibly the most underrated Unix tool</span></h1>

<main>


<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right&hellip; the title for this post might be one of the biggest truths
we see nowadays about a tool in Unix space. Although the name doesn&rsquo;t mean
anything special that describes the tool - it stands for the surname of its
creators: Alfred Aho, Peter J. Weinberger e Brian Kernighan, and guess what, at
Bell Labs - it really shines and <em>helps</em> in a niche that many of us work
everyday: <em>text processing</em>.</p>

<p>Every day we see more about &ldquo;big data&rdquo; processing, &ldquo;data science&rdquo;, &ldquo;business
intelligence&rdquo;, &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;, &hellip; but at the very fundamental steps for
each of this big words there are a common source: <em>text</em>, a <em>lot</em> of text.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have seen many good tools getting ignored throughout the time
on behalf of other options that we can arguably say they are &ldquo;fancier&rdquo; or, in
other words, misleadingly pointed as &ldquo;better&rdquo;. <em>awk</em> is a great example of such
tool that got forgotten and is very unlikely to be considered in the current
days by the new developers swamped in buzzwords.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not stating these other tools are actually
worse or not good enough, what I&rsquo;m saying actually is that AWK shouldn&rsquo;t be
ignored or considered &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; compared to these tools (like I&rsquo;ve heard
countless times about C being obsolete because isn&rsquo;t object-oriented, &hellip;
wait, what?! That&rsquo;s a subject for another post).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My goal with this post is to give a <em>really quick overview</em> of that tool, not to
convince you to use it anywhere, but just to let you know it still exists, it&rsquo;s
still used and it&rsquo;s still viable to some extent. Perhaps what I&rsquo;m trying to say
is: <em>stop for a sec and try to ignore any other new framework or tool about
text processing, try to use what you already have and didn&rsquo;t know</em>.</p>

<h2 id="basic-structure">Basic structure</h2>

<p>As many other Unix tools, <em>awk</em> handles <em>lines</em> as it input source; this lines
are then matched against the following rule:</p>

<p><center><code>&lt;pattern&gt; { &lt;action&gt; }</code></center></p>

<p>being <code>pattern</code> the match that triggers the <code>action</code>.</p>

<p>Although <code>pattern</code> can assume &ldquo;any&rdquo; value, there are two special ones: <code>BEGIN</code>
and <code>END</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-awk">BEGIN { &lt;action&gt; }
END { &lt;action&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p><code>BEGIN</code> triggers an <em>action</em> before the first line is handled, while <code>END</code>
triggers an <em>action</em> after the last line was processed, see:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ ls -l
total 0
-r--rw-r--. 1 bmeneg bmeneg 0 ago 19 19:43 file1
-r--r--r--. 1 bmeneg bmeneg 0 ago 19 19:44 file2
-rwxrw-r--. 1 bmeneg bmeneg 0 ago 19 19:45 file3
-rw-rw-r--. 1 bmeneg bmeneg 0 ago 19 19:45 file4
$ cat ../my-awk-program
BEGIN { print &quot;- START -&quot; }
{ print &quot;processing new input line ...&quot; }
END { print &quot;- DONE -&quot; }
$ ls -l | awk -f ../my-awk-program
- START -
processing new input line ...
processing new input line ...
processing new input line ...
processing new input line ...
processing new input line ...
- DONE -
$
</code></pre>

<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>

<p>You already can imagine a couple of use cases for a system administrator or an
automated task, right? Lets try to print the file name and the file owner of
our current folder.</p>

<pre><code class="language-awk">BEGIN { print &quot;name\towner&quot; }
END { print &quot;- done -&quot;}
{ print $9, &quot;\t&quot;, $3 }
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s run this <em>awk</em> program with our <code>ls -l</code> output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ ls -l | awk -f ../my-awk-program
name    owner
         
file1    bmeneg
file2    bmeneg
file3    bmeneg
file4    bmeneg
- done -
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: feel free to try adding <code>#!/usr/bin/awk -f</code> to the first line of the
program and set exec permission to that and then:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l | ../my-awk-program
</code></pre>

<p><em>awk</em> is also an interpreter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, yes, you can put your <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> anywhere in the program, every
pattern is checked for each input (line) processed. And second, <em>fields</em>, the
ones I used there, <code>$3</code> and <code>$9</code>, can be thought as Bash or Perl function
parameters, but the values they hold are actually the <em>fields</em> present in the
input. Consider <em>fields</em> like <em>columns</em> of a row (line), each number represents
the column number of that specific input being processed. But, unlike other
programming languages, the dollar sign <code>$</code> doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a <em>variable</em>,
which is also present in <em>awk</em>, but without <code>$</code>. Also, <em>fields</em> aren&rsquo;t expanded
within double quotes and that&rsquo;s the reason you see both being placed around
<code>&quot;\t&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Now, to demonstrate the use of real variables let me introduce you a more
elaborated example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-awk">#!//usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN {
    # variables can be declared anywhere
    my_name = &quot;awbot&quot;
    # remember, awk was made to handle text input
    print &quot;Hey user, tell me your name: &quot;
}
{
    # NF = number of fields
    # here we using it as a variable
    if (NF &gt; 1) {
        # and here we are using NF value to access the NFth (last) field
        # creating: 'first + last name' standard
        user_name = $1&quot; &quot;$NF
    } else {
        user_name = $1
    }

    print &quot;Hi&quot;, user_name &quot;! My name is&quot;, my_name
    exit
}
END {
    # variables are shared between patterns
    print &quot;Bye&quot;, user_name
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Wait, what is that??</em> Yes, that&rsquo;s right, <em>awk</em> has all those things you know
from other languages: conditions, loops, arithmetic operations, variables, &hellip;
you can indeed play around with the string being used as input to your program,
you can change the processing step depending the size of the input, or you can
even change that based on the string per se. For instance, add the following
rule right after the <code>BEGIN</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-awk">/^$/ || /^quit\s*/  {
    print &quot;Ok, quiting...&quot;
    exit
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will make the program quit whenever you enter an empty line or the word
<code>quit</code>. As you may have thought, if we&rsquo;re talking about text processing it&rsquo;s
almost mandatory to know something about <em>regular expressions</em>, this is the
core engine running behind this whole language.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: regular expression is something really useful and should be known by
every programmer to some extent, but at the same time it&rsquo;s not always
suitable for the job: it can turns into a really expensive operation. Make
sure you know when it should or not be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might be wondering what else can be done with <em>awk</em>, well, many things! It
accepts functions, it has builtin operations for substitution, and so on. The
amount of things you can do manipulating your input to give you a meaningful or
a more desirable output is countless. You can find <em>awk</em> being used in many
places of Linux ecosystem, for instance, within the Linux Kernel sources,
preparing file names based on file contents within Makefiles or a bunch of
projects packaging schemes for handling dynamic versioning, translation,
changelogs, an so on.</p>

<p>To finish, a final example, based on something I run in one of my daily task at
my job: consider the Linux kernel patch log, you need to retrieve some
information from patch headers and output it in a different way, not possible
using git&rsquo;s own <code>--pretty</code> feature. The input would be like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ git format-patch --first-parent -k --stdout v5.2..v5.3-rc5

</code></pre>

<p>This input goes on for about 14 patches.</p>

<p>And the <em>awk</em> program, with some comments to help you understand what is going
on and also possibly with some issues, is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-awk">BEGIN {
    total_patches = 0
    total_proc_patches = 0
}
/^From / {
    # store the second field from input
    commit_id = $2 
    total_patches++
    # get next input, ignoring next patterns
    next
}
/^From: / {
    # split the whole input using '&lt;' as delimiter
    nf = split($0, a, &quot;&lt;&quot;)
    # get everything after 7th char
    name = substr(a[1], 7)
    next
}
/^Date: / {
    date_dmy = $3&quot; &quot;$4&quot; &quot;$5
    next
}
/^Subject: / {
    # you also can recheck for a substring with regex
    # ignore merges and tagging commits
    if ($0 ~ &quot;([Rr]evert)?.*\&quot;?[Mm]erge.*&quot;) {
        next
    } else if ($0 ~ &quot;Linu[xs] [0-9].[0-9]&quot;) {
        next 
    }    
    subject = substr($0, 10)
    total_proc_patches++
    # NR = number of records (inputs)
    subj_nr = NR
    next
}
{
    if (NR == subj_nr+1) {
        if ($0 ~ &quot;^$&quot;) {
            # awk offers some builtin helper functions
            r = sprintf(&quot;[%s] %s\n%s\nby %s\n&quot;, date_dmy, commit_id, subject,
              name)
        } else if ($0 ~ &quot;^\\s&quot;) {
            r = sprintf(&quot;[%s] %s\n%s%s\nby %s\n&quot;, date_dmy, commit_id, subject,
              $0, name)
        }
        print r
    }
}
END {
    print &quot;-----&quot;
    print &quot;Total patches found:&quot;, total_patches
    print &quot;Total patches manipulated:&quot;, total_proc_patches
}

<p>And the output:</p>

<p>As you can see, with a not so complicated <em>awk</em> program I can somewhat easily
filter the input and generate my desirable output. And because of that, I
insist, don&rsquo;t hesitate in consider using <em>awk</em> for your daily basis tasks
around text processing.</p>

<h2 id="final-considerations">Final considerations</h2>

<p>I know there are other text processing tools, for instance, <em>sed</em> or even
<em>Perl</em>, which has a really powerful text processing engine, even faster than
<em>awk</em>, but sometimes the task to be performed doesn&rsquo;t require a complete
language to be used, or even you need to gather an specific column off that
specific line, why wouldn&rsquo;t I just call <em>awk</em> on its simplest form?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where I really like the idea of having more than one way to solve a
problem, or in this case, have more than a single tool.</p>

<p>Feel free to use whatever you want, but don&rsquo;t hesitate in consider other tools
you have in hand, tools that are very likely to be available by default in your
system, like <em>awk</em>.</p>
