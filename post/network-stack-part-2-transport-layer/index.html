<main>
<p>Ok, continuing our journey through the network stack downwards we just reached
the <em>transport layer</em>, where some of the <em>magics</em> behind the scenes happen.
This layer is where two of the most well known protocols are, being them TCP
(<em>Transmission Control Protocol</em>) and UDP (<em>User Datagram Protocol</em>).</p>
<p>These two protocols are used to the same purpose: <strong>provide a way to two
different applications (i.e. a HTTP client and a server) to communicate between
them accross the whole internet (or even in the same [local] system)</strong>.</p>
<p>With that said, the single question arises: <em>how the hell these guys work?</em>.
And that is exactly what I am going to try to explain and show you.</p>
<h2 id="tcp-and-udp-internals">TCP and UDP internals</h2>
<p>These two protocols are intended to work for the same main purpose, as stated
earlier, but they defer tremendously when comes to &ldquo;controlling&rdquo; the connection
itself, being that one - TCP - tries to keep the connection as reliable as
possible and transparent to the application, while the other - UDP - just give
up from everything on behalf of simplicity and performance, leaving the burden
of implementing some of the controlling mechanisms to the user&rsquo;s application,
if desired.</p>
<p>The way both protocols keep track of application&rsquo;s address is through <strong>port
numbers</strong>, which are controlled by the operating system and have a finite
amount available (16 bits = 65535). These ports are basically how house/street
numbers work: if you wish to talk to someone in a specific house, you need to
reach him in that specific number, but, at the same time, the application must
be waiting (listening) for someone in that specific port to allow the
communication to happen.</p>
<p>But wait, before we start to digress about that in a really high level, lets
take a look in how these information are organized, one protocol at a time, to
highlight the differences between them.</p>
<h3 id="tcp---overview-rfc-793httpstoolsietforghtmlrfc793">TCP - Overview (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">RFC 793</a>)</h3>
<p>The first thing to know is that each step downwards the stack a few bytes are
added to our whole packet size. That is due to header fields that are being
prefixed/suffixed each time a protocol manipulates it. For instance, TCP
protocol might add to our packet&rsquo;s length up to 60 bytes of information.</p>
<p>Below is an image representing all header fields available:</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/tcp-headers.png" alt="TCP Headers"></p>
<p>As the protocol&rsquo;s name already states, TCP is basically a protocol to control
the delivery of packets through the network to end user applications. What most
shines herein is the fact that TCP guarantees certain principles to the application
layer, these being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection establishment;</li>
<li>Reliable data transfer, through:
<ul>
<li><em>sequence number</em> (SEQ) header field;</li>
<li><em>acknowledgement number</em> (ACK) header field;</li>
<li>Flow control mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Using <em>window</em> field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bandwidth congestion control mechanism, through:
<ul>
<li>ACK field and some internal timers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, all the headers are basically used to control and handle a
transparent communication channel among applications within the internet.</p>
<p>But at the same time, <strong>why is these guarantees even necessary?</strong> Well,
basically because the internet itself is not a reliable system: it has
uncountable failures down the road with bogus systems, malfunctioning
equipment, broken or totally filled/busy links, and so forth. Depending on the
channel being used to transmit the packet it might be pretty hard to reach a
destination application, geographically distance, without hitting a single
issue and that is the reasoning behind all these control flags, fields and
mechanisms.</p>
<p>It is also valid to remember that although the network stack still have more
protocols underneath transport layer, TCP is the one caring the responsibility
to deliver a transparent and reliable network to the application.</p>
<p>Now, lets talk about these three guarantees.</p>
<h3 id="tcp---connection-establishment">TCP - Connection establishment</h3>
<p>This step is also known as <em>handshake</em>, which provides enough information to
keep the connection open and alive until one of the parts closes it. This step
brings some guarantees that help and can facilitate the architecture behind the
next protocol&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>Although many people don&rsquo;t really pay attention to this step I think it&rsquo;s worth
mentioning since some networking security issues are directly related to it.
But at the same time, I won&rsquo;t getting in much detail about the security aspect
of that, it&rsquo;s subject for another whole series of posts.</p>
<p>Before the handshake starts the server side of the connection must bind to and
listen to a specific port on its system. Once it&rsquo;s ready for receiving
connections (represented to a call to the <em>listen()</em> system call) the client
can actively open a connection to the server by calling the <em>connect()</em> system
call. The connection request is then received by the server system which waits
for a direct call to <em>accept()</em> from the server application, and once it&rsquo;s
issued the <em>3-way handshake</em> can start.</p>
<h4 id="3-way-handshake">3-way handshake</h4>
<p>This handshake set the values for both directions packets' sequence numbers,
which has its first value set randomly and also guarantees both sides are aware
that if they wish to finish the connection they must start the termination
process, and not just drop the other without any warnings (although it doesn&rsquo;t
prevent on endpoint or another to drop due to connection issues).</p>
<p>At client active open connection time a SYN packet is sent to the server with a
random sequence number (<code>$SEQ_{cli}$</code>) chosen by the client. The server then
sends a reply, SYN+ACK packet, with its acknowledgment number set to the
clients sequence number plus one (<code>$SEQ_{cli} + 1$</code>), and the packet sequence
number is also set to a randomly generated number (<code>$SEQ_{server}$</code>). Then,
finally, the client replies with an ACK packet containing the acknowledge
number set to <code>$SEQ_{server} + 1$</code> and the sequence number set to <code>$SEQ_{cli} + 1$</code>.</p>
<p>As I said before, this process helps to keep the connection alive, but at the
same time open some security holes allowing attackers perform attacks like DoS,
issuing multiple SYN packets at the same time. But hey, that&rsquo;s a concern for
another post. Lets move on.</p>
<h3 id="tcp---reliable-data-transfer">TCP - Reliable Data Transfer</h3>
<p>As I said before, there are three variables being monitored to keep the data
transfer between applications reliable: packet&rsquo;s sequence number,
acknowledgment number and the mechanism of flow control, which basically checks
for the window size field together with the other two variables.</p>
<h4 id="sequence-number">Sequence number</h4>
<p>Lets consider the sequence number first chosen in the handshake were 0 for both
directions, this will make our discussion easier, it represents the order in
which such packet was sent, being the number the last byte of that packet
counted since the beginning of the whole data being sent.</p>
<p>For example, consider a data of a thousand bytes, which was decided to be
fragmented in ten smaller packets of a hundred bytes each:</p>
<p><code>$$1000{bytes} = 10\times 100{bytes}$$</code></p>
<p>For each chunk of 100 bytes the sequence number is increased by that amount in
that specific packet.</p>
<h4 id="acknowledgment-number">Acknowledgment number</h4>
<p>This number is used in the ACK packet, which determines the last packet&rsquo;s
sequence number received. If the last packet received had SEQ equivalent to
200, than the acknowledgment number for the ACK packet will be <code>$200 + 1 = 201$</code>, meaning that the packet with SEQ 200 was received and it&rsquo;s now waiting
for the next packet starting from SEQ 201.</p>
<h4 id="flow-control">Flow control</h4>
<p>Flow control take in consideration the remaining size of sender&rsquo;s data buffer,
represented by the <em>window</em> field in the header, in other words, how many bytes
are still left to be filled in the sender&rsquo;s data queue, thus the other side of
the connection know how many bytes he can send within the next packet without
overflowing the buffer for that sender.</p>
<p>Bundling the last <em>window</em> number with both last SEQ and ACK number it&rsquo;s
possible to avoid flow issues due to overflowing buffers and, consequently,
duplicate packets in the channel due to retransmission.</p>
<h3 id="tcp---congestion-control">TCP - Congestion control</h3>
<p>As a starting point, TCP tries to avoid any unnecessary data transmission
between connection endpoints with the go-back-n approach, which specifies an
amount of bytes the sender can send before require waiting for an ACK packet
from receiver.</p>
<p>But the real congestion control happens with the increase of this maximum
amount of bytes not acknowledged in transit threshold, which is doubled each
time the sender successfully receives the receiver&rsquo;s ACK (process known as
<em>slow start</em>), until to the point a doubled ACK (meaning the last data sent was
not received) happens and the threshold is then dropped by half of the current
value, thus dropping the data transmission and possibly helping controlling the
channel congestion.</p>
<p>The following picture helps to understand the above statement about the
threshold, took from the Computer Network book from Kurose &amp; Ross.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/tcp-cwnds.png" alt="TCP Congestion Control"></p>
<p>Just for your information, there are more than one algorithms of TCP congestion
control, each one might have a different focus, resulting in different
behaviors. As you can see in the last picture, there were two different
implementations of congestion control algorithms, being one TCP Tahoe and the
another Reno.</p>
<h3 id="udp---overview-rfc-768httpstoolsietforghtmlrfc768">UDP - Overview (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768">RFC 768</a>)</h3>
<p>Different from what we have seen about TCP, UDP is the smaller and simpler one.
Its focus is basically in performance. All the controlling mechanisms are left
to the application layer handle, in case it feels it&rsquo;s necessary somehow.</p>
<p>And as you may see in the header image below the UDP header doesn&rsquo;t have
anything else other than the basic fields that a transport protocol should
handle: <em>source</em> and <em>destination</em> port, the length of the header and the
checksum of the whole datagram.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/udp-headers.png" alt="UDP Headers"></p>
<p>Because of that there isn&rsquo;t much to say about the UDP other than: it is the
materialization of the most basic concept of what can be a transport layer
protocol, there aren&rsquo;t any kind of guarantee regarding delivery or link in
which the packets are being transmitted.</p>
<p>This might seem something bad, or that should never be used, but that&rsquo;s not
true. There are multiple use cases where UDP is desirable, mostly where some
packet losses aren&rsquo;t much important or where the application has some kind of
data correction.</p>
<p>As the time passes the link quality available for normal users are getting
cheaper and better, making many UDP users migrate to TCP, since the overhead
added are relatively also getting cheaper. That&rsquo;s more a judgment call
considering your project&rsquo;s specifications.</p>
<h2 id="recap-from-application-layer-packet">Recap from application layer packet</h2>
<p>We are now going to take the results we got in <a href="/posts/net-stack-app">part 1</a>
of this series and literally encapsulate it within the, what is called,
<em>payload</em> from transport layer protocol&rsquo;s <em>segment</em>.</p>
<h3 id="stack-analysis">Stack analysis</h3>
<p>Using HTTP client side of our application and remembering that HTTP protocols
uses TCP protocol as its transport layer, the request content that will be held
by TCP&rsquo;s payload is:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.61.1
&gt; Accept: */*
</code></pre><p>And to manually check this payload content to the most low level perspective,
we can use the <em>tcpdump</em> tool to monitor the network interface (<strong>lo</strong> in this
case, since we are working with <em>localhost</em>) for all incoming and outgoing
packets in a transport layer point of view, while sending requests to the
server:</p>
<pre><code># tcpdump --dont-verify-checksums -i lo -X -n -v 'port 8080'
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>NOTE: the <code>--dont-verify-checksums</code> option was used to hide checksum errors
from output. It&rsquo;s required due to the checksum offloading my operating system
is performing letting the checksum creation responsibility to the network
device instead of the os' TCP stack.</p>

</code></pre><p>If we start checking all bytes/bits of both segments we&rsquo;re going to see that
the values there present matches the values presented by <em>tcpdump</em> output in
the second line, where <em>flags</em>, <em>seq</em>, <em>ack</em>, <em>win</em>, <em>options</em> and <em>length</em> are
all TCP header fields and its values are decoded.</p>
<p>Before we finish, just for your information, the <em>tcpdump</em> command I used
prompted many other packets other than these two I presented above, those other
packets are the SYNs and FINs used to connection establishment and ending
respectively. I won&rsquo;t describe then in here, but will let it as exercise for
those interested. Also, reading the manpage of the tool you&rsquo;re going to see a
way for avoiding them from being prompted.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen either application and transport layers it&rsquo;s time to dive
into the network layer, where the most well known protocol is placed: Internet
Protocol (IP).</p>
